For unit testing, it is very essential to write code that tests individual tests for our classes.

Below we have unit testind class to test pieces of our code. In the TrafficForecasterTests.zip, there are two classes that will test the individual methods.
The users will have to run the unit testing code and it will give output if the test passes or not. These classes are designed for Java Unit Testings.
